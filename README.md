<u><b>Fashion-MNIST</u></b>

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in 
replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of
training and testing splits.

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Label</th>	<th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td>	<td>T-shirt/top</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td>	<td>	Trouser</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td>	<td>	Pullover</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td>	<td>	Dress</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td>	<td>	Coat</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td>	<td>	Sandal</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td>	<td>	Shirt</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td>	<td>	Sneaker</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td>	<td>	Bag</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td>	<td>	Ankle boot</td></tr>
